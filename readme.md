## Building

Assuming you are on a linux-like system

```
make
```

## Usage

To play wordle:

```
./wordle
```

The program will provide guesses. Play them manually on the website and enter
the response as a five-letter string such as "BGYGB" (B-Black, G-Green,
Y-Yellow)

The multi-board wordle clones can be played similarly, such as

```
./dordle
```

To play an arbitrary number of simultaneous wordle boards with an arbirary
number of attempts, you can try

```
./wordle -b 4 -a 13
```

Play nerdle the same way with `./nerdle`, except the colours are now B-Black,
G-Green, R-Red.

To play crosswordle with `./crosswordle`, provide the responses from top to
bottom such as `BYBBB YBBGB â€¦ GGGGG` followed by the actual word. See
`data/crosswordle_sample.in` for an example
